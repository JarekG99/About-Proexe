          <h4>What if a storm hits Hilton Head Island before you get ready to go on vacation? The answer is simple… stay home! But before you unpack, just check to make sure whether the Island has been affected. We have had many tropical storm warnings
              over the years, but unlike Florida we’ve been extremely fortunate. In our opinion, the best offense is defense. </h4>

            <p class="note-container no-margin"> Weather Channel site and the National Hurricane Centers site are two excellent resources. At Hilton Head Rentals we recommend the following. Use the services of a travel professional, especially if you will be vacationing during hurricane
                season. When buying vacation packages through a vacation rental property management company or a travel agency, it will reduce your stress because travel professionals are your advocates and are ready to help you through difficult
                travel scenarios. If a vacation is booked online it may be difficult to get through to one of their representatives. On Hilton Head Island there are a lot of different vacation companies that offer a variety of vacation insurance
                plans. If you book directly with a vacation rental management company that offers homes, villas and condos, they will in all likelihood have insurance plans to offer. If you’re working with a travel agent, they can assist you in
                determining which plan provides the best coverage for the right price. Some even offer a “cancel for any reason” waiver, allowing you to see that a hurricane might be swirling for Hilton Head. With this type of plan, your travel
                professionals can quickly use their resources to find an alternate resort area so your vacation won’t be sacrificed.
